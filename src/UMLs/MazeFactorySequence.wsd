title MazeRunner Sequence with Factory Method

participant Main
participant Configuration as Config
participant MazeFactory as MF
participant FileMazeFactory as FMF
participant Maze
participant SolverCommandFactory as SCF
participant MazeSolverCommand as Solver

Main -> Config: new(args)
Main -> MF: createMaze(config)
MF -> FMF: createMaze(config)
FMF -> Maze: new()
Maze --> FMF
FMF --> MF
MF --> Main

Main -> SCF: create(config)
SCF -> Solver: new()
Solver --> SCF
SCF --> Main

note right of MF: MazeFactory delegates creation\nto a specific implementation (FileMazeFactory).
note right of SCF: SolverCommandFactory selects solver\nbased on configuration.
